# Hash-Crack
How is possible to crack MD5 hash code using deep neural network!

This mini project is about to estimate the output of a hash function(MD5) using deep neural networks using PyTorch.
I have created a sample dataset out of random strings and using md5 output to train the model.
Although, this project come out of a fun idea, there is not any pattern in an md5 hash function to predict!
